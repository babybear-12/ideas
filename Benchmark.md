# ZK Benchmark

### Goals
- Benchmark different ZK proofs for same program (like addition, multiplication, fibonacci to increasingly complex). 
- Measure prover, verifier time, parallel execution, proof size, CPU usage, memory usage, verifier gas consumtion etc. 
- Mainly get familiar with running, generating proof for different projects and get metrics about their overall performance, developer friendliness.
- Unlike other projects, it will require minimal co-ordination, task-breakdown, team members can work parallelly, finding can be aggregated.
- (May be) Facilitate program execution, visualize findings from web interface.

### Projects
- Scroll, Halo2 + KGZ
- Jolt
- Nexus zkVM
- SP1, Plonky3
- Circom 10 + snarkjs 4 / rapidsnark 11
- Gnark
- Arkworks
- Stakeware
- Miden VM
- Risc Zero
- Aleo
- ............more to be added

### Expected Output 
- Somewhat mini version of [Benchmarking ZKP Development Frameworks: the Pantheon of ZKP](https://ethresear.ch/t/benchmarking-zkp-development-frameworks-the-pantheon-of-zkp/14943)
- [ZK Bench Dev](https://zkbench.dev)
    - May even extend it to support more projects.
